# blog
A basic site that will render articles based on a local directory. 

## Project intentions
The goal of this project was to familiarize myself with the libs for http and templates. This is by no means recommended as it is barebones and very much an MVP. Upon release, the live site can be viewed here.


## Env requirements
PORT
DIR(full path)
